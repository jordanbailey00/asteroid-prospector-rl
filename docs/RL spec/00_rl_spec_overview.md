Below is a **formal Gymnasium-style RL spec** for **Asteroid Belt Prospector**, designed to be **PufferLib-friendly** (fixed-size `Box` observation, `Discrete` actions, macro-actions that consume variable “time units,” and fast CPU stepping). It directly implements the ship state, partial observability, action set, and reward design from your GDD. fileciteturn2file3L7-L31 fileciteturn2file0L29-L76
