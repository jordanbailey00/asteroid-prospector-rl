# Project Status

Last updated: 2026-02-28
Current focus: M2.5 parity convergence and training gate readiness

## Current state

- Frozen interface status: unchanged (`OBS_DIM=260`, `N_ACTIONS=69`, action indexing `0..68`, reward definition unchanged).
- Build health: local checks passing via `tools/run_checks.ps1` (`pytest -q` currently 24 passed).
- Completed milestones: M0, M1, M2, and M2.5 implementation complete.
- Active milestone: parity mismatch reduction and training gate enforcement.

## Milestone board

| Milestone | Status | What is done | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M0 - Scaffold and hello env | Complete | Repo skeleton, tooling, CI, contract stub env | `001a004` |
| M1 - Python reference env | Complete | Reference environment, tier tests, determinism and reward checks | `b009f53`, `6e33091`, `b4e31bd` |
| M2 - Native core + bindings | Complete | Full C world/step dynamics, reward + obs packing, expanded native parity metrics surfaced through ctypes | `5aa1058` |
| M2.5 - Parity harness | Complete | `tools/run_parity.py` fixed-suite harness with seed matrix, tolerance compares, and mismatch bundle output | pending (this commit) |
| M3 - Training + window metrics | Not started | Puffer training loop and W&B window logging | pending |
| M4 - Eval + replay generation | Not started | Eval runner, replay recorder, replay indexing | pending |
| M5 - API server | Not started | Run/replay/play endpoints | pending |
| M6 - Frontend integration | Not started | Replay player, play mode, analytics | pending |
| M7+ - Perf and stability | Not started | Throughput targets, soak checks, benchmark automation | pending |

## Next work (ordered)

1. Run the full parity matrix and resolve native/reference mismatches until tolerance thresholds pass.
2. Enforce training-start gating on parity pass criteria from `docs/ACCEPTANCE_TESTS_PARITY_HARNESS.md`.
3. Start M3 windowed trainer and W&B artifact logging after parity is stable.

## Active risks and blockers

- Main risk: remaining stochastic and numerical drift between Python reference and C core in parity runs.
- Main blocker for training scale-up: parity cases currently produce mismatch bundles and need convergence work.

## Decision pointers

- See `docs/DECISION_LOG.md` for accepted architecture and process decisions.

## Update policy (required)

- Every commit must update at least one tracking file:
  - `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, or
  - `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`, or
  - `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Any non-trivial technical decision must include a new entry in `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`.
- Keep the "Next work (ordered)" section current so remaining direction is explicit.
