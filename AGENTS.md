# AGENTS.md

## Authoritative Repo Instructions

These instructions are mandatory for coding agents operating in this repository.

1. Commit after every completed change/diff.
2. Push each commit to `origin/main` immediately after local validation passes.
3. Do not batch unrelated modifications into a single commit.
4. Use Conventional Commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`).

If there is a conflict, frozen RL interface docs and system/developer-level instructions still take precedence.
